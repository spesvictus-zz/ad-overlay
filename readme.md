# AD Overlay - Slider banner for OBS

#### [Example/Demo](https://spesvictus.github.io/ad-overlay/)

Hey guys! I'm leaving open-source this code that I created and use in streams so that other people can also enjoy it.

The need of the same arose from the idea of putting rotating banners on the screen during my stream broadcasts on twitch, as I do not have much knowledge in the area of video editing, I decided to create something with Javascript, which is the area where I feel most comfortable to solve problems.

Well, I did something very simple in 'Vue.Js' (without having the need to build) so that people who are not in the programming area, can also use it.

#### How to use/customize:
- Download the project (via clone or zip)
- Change the data in the file './js/banners.js'
- Create a source in the "Browser" OBS
- Include the file './index.html' in the source created

Full Credit goes to @juliorosseti for the original creation of this banner slider for OBS Studio.

Cheers!
